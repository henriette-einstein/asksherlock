## Assessment and Plan

Mr. Holmes' fatigue and chest pain are concerning for a possible cardiac condition. We will obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a lipid profile to evaluate his cardiovascular health. We will also recommend a sleep study to evaluate his chronic insomnia and a nutritional evaluation to address his poor dietary habits. Given his history of depression, anxiety, and OCD, we will recommend counseling or therapy and consider medication management. We will also monitor for any signs of relapse in his drug addiction and provide resources for continued recovery.
