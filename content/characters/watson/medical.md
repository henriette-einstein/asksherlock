## Assessment and Plan

Dr. Watson's chronic shoulder pain is likely related to his previous injury sustained during the war. We will obtain an x-ray of the shoulder to evaluate for any structural abnormalities. His occasional shortness of breath will also be further evaluated with pulmonary function tests and possibly a chest x-ray. We will continue his current medications and monitor for any adverse effects. We will also recommend counseling or therapy to address his history of depression and anxiety.
